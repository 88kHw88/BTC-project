# BTC-project (readme under construction)

This is a project to visualize the historical prices of Bitcoin (BTC). We determine the 50 day moving average (50 MA) and the 200 day moving average (200 MA) to predict the Golden Cross of Death Cross. A prediction of about 25 days ahead is made. Historical prices are taken from https://finance.yahoo.com

Some ideas that I want to do in this project are:
- Sentimental Analysis on Bitcoin
- Include Fear and Greed meter in this project
